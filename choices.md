# Implementation language
I recommend one of the following and if you use some other language you can expect less well put together support
    - C
    - C/C++
    - C#
    - Go
    - Rust

# Documentation format
The documentation for your system and programming language must be in a consistent format
        Bonus points for making the documentation avalible from the system
        Bonus points for style
